    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
      <p>The lack of reproducibility is a growing concern in research. As
      a postdoctoral fellow with Leo Held at the Center for Reproducible Science
      (<a href="http://www.crs.uzh.ch">www.crs.uzh.ch</a>) my aim is to help to
      improve the quality and robustness of research at the University of Zurich.
      Particularly, I'm involved in the training of good research
      practices across faculties and in original meta-research.
      I currently lead two research projects, the first about publication
      bias, and the second in methods reproducibility. I also teach Biostatistics
      at medical school at UZH.
      I have a multidisciplinary background with degrees in psychology,
      computer science, and neuroscience. I was a SNSF mobility fellow with Tom Nichols
      at the University of Warwick and the University of Oxford. I received training in MR physics
      and MR analysis at FMRIB at Oxford.</p>

        <p>Psychiatric disorders are common in our society. These disorders affect the brain
        and often cause tremendous personal distress. In my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow
        at Oxford University I focus on understanding brain connectivity in healthy and
        psychiatric conditions. Previous research has demonstrated
        that psychiatric disorders such as phobia, depression, and schizophrenia exhibit
        abnormalities in brain systems and their communication. I collaborate with
        mathematicians and statisticians, and I am particularly interested in new
        computational methods to explore brain connectivity. In the long run, new methods will
        hopefully improve the understanding, the diagnosis and the prognosis of such diseases,
        and may play an important role in personalized medicine in the future.</p>
